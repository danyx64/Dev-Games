## 8 Ball Pool (Miniclip) PWA

This version is the webapp available at 8ballpool.com/game.
I created this PWA just to optimize it because their version does not cache anything and the game is loaded every single time and is damn slow.
Also this version is in a glorious full screen.

I wish it could work also on mobiles and I am sure there is a way, but I don't know how.

If anyone can help it would be great. More about it here: https://github.com/0wwafa/8ball/issues/1

**New Update:**  
  
Initial support for mobile version!!!  
To aim: **tap anywhere and drag your finger**  
To shoot: **do a double tap first** then **drag your finger to set the power** and **release**  

Everything else **works!**

Use **Add to Home Screen** on Android or [download the pre-made (by Chrome) APK](https://github.com/0wwafa/8ball/releases/download/V0.0.2/8.Ball.Pool.PWA.apk).


Meanwhile **enjoy** (on pc/mac/linux browsers)
